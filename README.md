# anki-canvas

This is a touch based canvas for drawing shapes in [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) and Desktop Anki.

Compared to AnkiDroid's own native whiteboard which is designed to take notes,
this is meant for **use cases where the the user has to draw a shape as an
answer to the card** (for example: **Kanji/Hanzi drawing practice**,
Remembering the Kanji, etc).


### Download & Install

Download the premade Anki deck from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pigoz/anki-canvas/releases/latest) and import it into Anki.
